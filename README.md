# OWL Exchange Plug-in for Archi®

## Purpose

The purpose of this plug-in is an attempt to import and export an ArchiMate model in Archi® the ArchiMate modelling tool using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). It's not clear to me whether it is reasonably possible to represent ArchiMate's graphical data using OWL, or whether there is anything to be gained by using OWL at all.

This is a work in progress. Things that need to be done:

* A complete ontology of ArchiMate concepts and relations needs to be defined.
* Relationships need to be represented as similar to a NamedIndividual so that name/documentation/properties can be attached.
* All components need to be referenced in Views.
* Graphical diagrams need to be represented 
* Much more!
